# Bamazon

## What it does

Bamazon is a MySQL/Node application that allows users to "purchase" items as a customer.

## How it does it 

The Bamazon Customer Portal allows the user to view the current items available. The user will then be prompted to enter the item id, and then how many of the item they wish to purchase. 
If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the user will see the total amount of their purchase. The MySQL database will then be updated to reflect the amount of items in stock.

If the amount of items chosen exceeds the amount of items in stock, the app will let the user know and the user will be prompted to submit another amount for the item.
